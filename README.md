A Charles Babbage Tribute Page

This is a tribute page for Charles Babbage, the father of computers.

Also part of my first FCC's responsive web design project that is to build a tribute page.

This is a single page site and built by only using HTML/CSS with no Javascript involved.

The live version of this page can be found here:

Passed all 10 tests.
